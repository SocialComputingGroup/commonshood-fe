# Commonshood Frontend

This repo is the alpha and currently in-development version of the dapp of Commonshood.

The project was built using:
- React (create-react-app)
- Redux
- React-Router
- Web3.js
- Axios
- i18next

**NOTE**: to run this project you need to have a running instance of **commonshood-be**, to have deployed all the contracts in **commonshood-contracts** and to have correctly set a file called `config.js` inside the folder `src`. You can take as an example the data you find in `src/config-TEMPLATE.js`


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
